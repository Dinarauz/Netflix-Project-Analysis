## Key Objectives

## Key Business Questions
1. Which country has the highest number of subscriptions by method?
2. Which genre is most watched by gender? Which genre is most popular by country? 
3. Does monthly income affect the choice of subscription method and plan? What percentage of users renew their subscriptions after their initial plan duration ends?
4. What is the retention rate based on join and last payment dates? Is there a seasonal trend in user join dates or subscription renewals?

## Key Findings

### 1. Top Countries by Subscription Method

My questions are based on getting to know subscribers, such as the highest number of subscribers based on their country of residence. I was also curious to identify viewing patterns based on gender preferences.
Not to mention if income affects the subscription plans and methods. Lastly retention rate by measuring how well does or doesn't retain its users over time.
Which I thought would be a great insight for a marketing team, content recommendations, and improving retention.
