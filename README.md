Subscription Patterns, Content Preferences & Retention Insights

Analyzed Netflix user data to understand what keeps subscribers engaged, what content they watch, and how different demographics choose subscription plans. Found some surprising patterns in genre preferences and incredibly high retention rates.

**Dataset:** Kaggle Netflix Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chul24/data-neflix/data

## Key Objectives
**Subscription Behavior:**
• Which countries have the most subscribers and what plans do they choose?
• Does income actually affect which plan people pick?

**Content Preferences:**
• What genres do men vs women prefer?
• Are there regional differences in content taste?

**User Retention:**
• How many people actually renew their subscriptions?
• What's the typical retention period?
• Any seasonal patterns in sign-ups or renewals?

## Key Findings
